# Remember

- Execute your instructions faithfully, no more, no less. If this is a written plan, follow it step by step.
- Ask for clarification rather than assume.
- Report completion of each major step. Be concise.
- Realize when you're stuck or looping. If so, you MUST read the `seeking-guidance` guide.
