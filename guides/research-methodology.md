# Research Methodology

Research transforms questions into knowledge through three iterative phases: Divergence, Gathering, Convergence.

## Phase 1: Divergence

**Break the question into answerable sub-questions.**

1. Examine the question for ambiguity
2. Identify required knowledge
3. Break into concrete sub-questions
4. Map dependencies (what must be answered first?)
5. Organize as pyramid: foundational → synthesis

**Stop when:**
- Each sub-question can be answered with targeted research
- Path from facts to conclusion is visible

**Avoid:**
- Searching before knowing what you're looking for
- Treating all questions equally (prioritize foundational)


## Phase 2: Gathering

**Find trustworthy information for your sub-questions.**

For each sub-question:
1. Search for sources, evaluating credibility.
2. Fetch and analyze information, noting source and level of confidence.

### Source Credibility Framework

Evaluate each source:

**Authority:** Relevant expertise? Primary or secondary? Reputable publisher?
**Bias:** Commercial interests? Acknowledges alternatives? Neutral tone?
**Evidence:** Data-backed or asserted? Traceable to primary sources? Sound methodology?
**Recency:** Current for the field? Outdated by recent developments?

**Heuristics:**
- Start with highest-authority sources
- When sources conflict, seek tie-breakers
- When all agree, verify it's not groupthink
- Absence of evidence is data - note gaps explicitly

**Avoid:**
- Confirmation bias (stopping at first agreeing source)
- Treating all web results equally
- Confusing opinion with fact
- Missing echo chambers (all sources trace to one origin)


## Phase 3: Convergence

**Transform information into justified conclusions.**

1. Review gathered information
3. Draw conclusions backed by sources, with confidence level assessment
6. Note remaining uncertainties

**Avoid:**
- Claims stronger than evidence
- Ignoring contradictions
- Hiding uncertainty
- Conclusions that don't follow from evidence


## Iteration

You may run these phases more than once. 

- **Loop back to Divergence if:** question was poorly framed, new sub-questions emerged, problem more complex than understood
- **Loop back to Gathering if:** sources conflict, confidence too low, gaps identified, claims lack evidence
- **Loop back to Convergence if:** new information changes conclusions, conflicts resolved, new patterns emerge


Research is complete when sub-questions are answered with appropriate confidence and uncertainties are documented, and you have an answer to the main question.
