Research transforms questions into knowledge through three iterative phases: Divergence, Gathering, Convergence.

# Phase 1: Divergence

**Break the question into answerable sub-questions.**

1. Examine the question for ambiguity
2. Identify required knowledge
3. Break into concrete sub-questions
4. Map dependencies (what must be answered first?)
5. Organize as pyramid: foundational → synthesis

**Stop when:**
- Each sub-question can be answered with targeted research
- Dependencies are clear
- Path from facts to conclusion is visible

**Avoid:**
- Searching before knowing what you're looking for
- Treating all questions equally (prioritize foundational)
- Decomposition more complex than the original question


# Phase 2: Gathering

**Find trustworthy information for your sub-questions.**

For each sub-question:
1. Search for authoritative sources
2. Evaluate credibility (framework below)
3. Extract information, noting source and confidence
4. Cross-reference claims
5. Flag conflicts and gaps

## Source Credibility Framework

Evaluate each source:

**Authority:** Relevant expertise? Primary or secondary? Reputable publisher?
**Bias:** Commercial interests? Acknowledges alternatives? Neutral tone?
**Evidence:** Data-backed or asserted? Traceable to primary sources? Sound methodology?
**Recency:** Current for the field? Outdated by recent developments?

**Confidence levels:**
- HIGH: Primary sources, peer-reviewed research, official docs, unbiased domain experts
- MEDIUM: Reputable secondary sources, expert opinion with reasoning
- LOW: Anonymous sources, biased advocacy, outdated info, unsupported claims

**Heuristics:**
- Start with highest-authority sources
- When sources conflict, seek tie-breakers
- When all agree, verify it's not groupthink
- Absence of evidence is data - note gaps explicitly

**Avoid:**
- Confirmation bias (stopping at first agreeing source)
- Treating all web results equally
- Confusing opinion with fact
- Missing echo chambers (all sources trace to one origin)


# Phase 3: Convergence

**Transform information into justified conclusions.**

1. Review gathered information
2. Identify patterns and connections
3. Draw conclusions backed by sources
4. Generate insights beyond any single source
5. Assess confidence levels (see writing-reports guide)
6. Note remaining uncertainties

**Synthesis techniques:**

**Pattern Recognition:** Multiple descriptions of same phenomenon? Recurring themes? Explicit vs. implied?
**Critical Analysis:** Why do sources disagree? What assumptions underlie conclusions? Logical gaps? Second-order effects?
**Knowledge Creation:** Insights from combining sources? How does evidence interact? Practical implications? Trade-offs?

**Avoid:**
- Merely restating sources
- Claims stronger than evidence
- Ignoring contradictions
- Hiding uncertainty
- Conclusions that don't follow from evidence


# Iteration

Research is complete when sub-questions are answered with appropriate confidence and uncertainties are documented.

**Loop back to Divergence if:** Question was poorly framed, new sub-questions emerged, problem more complex than understood
**Loop back to Gathering if:** Sources conflict, confidence too low, gaps identified, claims lack evidence
**Loop back to Convergence if:** New information changes conclusions, conflicts resolved, new patterns emerge

# Operational Guidelines

**Scale appropriately:** Match depth to importance (tactical: 3-4 sources; strategic: comprehensive)
**Handle ambiguity:** Clarify unclear questions before diving deep; reframe if needed
**Recognize gaps:** State explicitly when information is scarce, sources conflict, or assumptions are required
**Manage conflicts:** Don't force resolution where none exists; inconclusive is a valid finding
**Generate insights:** Connect across sources, identify implications, think through second-order effects

# Self-Check

- [ ] Every claim traceable to source
- [ ] Confidence levels explicit
- [ ] Multiple perspectives represented
- [ ] Disagreements analyzed
- [ ] Gaps stated
- [ ] Insights add value beyond sources
