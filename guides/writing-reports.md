# Writing Reports

Reports transform investigation into knowledge that others can act on, audit, and build upon.

## Purpose

A report lets readers:
- Understand conclusions quickly
- Follow reasoning from evidence to conclusions
- Evaluate evidence strength
- Identify disagreement points
- Act with appropriate confidence

A report is NOT: chronological log, data dump, stream-of-thought, or false certainty.

Trust your reader to infer connections. Be concise and insightful, not exhaustive.


## Structure

**Introduction (1 paragraph):** Question, why it matters, scope

**Body (flexible):** Present findings logically, build from facts to conclusions, cite sources, show reasoning, address alternatives

**Conclusions (bullets):** Direct answers with confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), implications, caveats

**Optional:** Executive summary (long reports), source evaluation (contentious credibility), methodology (process matters), appendices (supporting data)


## Confidence Levels

Uncertainty is a finding, not failure. State confidence explicitly in terms of LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CERTAIN.

Examples:
- "GraphQL requires explicit field selection (CERTAIN: official spec)"
- "The process takes 2-3 months (HIGH: multiple user accounts report this)"
- "Performance gain 50-90% (LOW: depends on unmeasured usage patterns)"

**When inconclusive:** State it directly. Then add value: what's needed to conclude? Arguments for each side? Risks of deciding under uncertainty? Cost of more research vs. deciding now?


## Citations

**Cite:** Facts, statistics, non-common-knowledge claims, quotes, controversial info, technical specs
**Don't cite:** Your inferences, common knowledge, obvious connections

**Format:** Inline, non-intrusive, with enough detail to assess credibility and find source

Examples: `[Source: OpenAI API Documentation, 2024]` `[Source: Smith et al., peer-reviewed GraphQL study]` `[Source: Internal codebase]`
