Reports transform investigation into knowledge that others can act on, audit, and build upon.

# Purpose

A report lets readers:
- Understand conclusions quickly
- Follow reasoning from evidence to conclusions
- Evaluate evidence strength
- Identify disagreement points
- Act with appropriate confidence

A report is NOT: chronological log, data dump, stream-of-thought, or false certainty.

Trust your reader to infer connections. Be concise and insightful, not exhaustive.


# Structure

**Introduction (1 paragraph):** Question, why it matters, scope

**Body (flexible):** Present findings logically, build from facts to conclusions, cite sources, show reasoning, address alternatives

**Conclusions (bullets):** Direct answers with confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), implications, caveats

**Optional:** Executive summary (long reports), source evaluation (contentious credibility), methodology (process matters), appendices (supporting data)


# Confidence Levels

Uncertainty is a finding, not failure. State confidence explicitly:

**HIGH:** Multiple authoritative sources agree, strong evidence, clear reasoning, few assumptions
**MEDIUM:** Limited sources, reasonable inference, some assumptions, competing perspectives
**LOW:** Sparse/conflicting evidence, significant assumptions, extrapolation, high uncertainty

Examples:
- "GraphQL requires explicit field selection (HIGH: official spec)"
- "Adoption takes 2-3 months (MEDIUM: team surveys from similar projects)"
- "Performance gain 50-90% (LOW: depends on unmeasured usage patterns)"

**When inconclusive:** State it directly. Then add value: what's needed to conclude? Arguments for each side? Risks of deciding under uncertainty? Cost of more research vs. deciding now?


# Citations

**Cite:** Facts, statistics, non-common-knowledge claims, quotes, controversial info, technical specs
**Don't cite:** Your inferences, common knowledge, obvious connections

**Format:** Inline, non-intrusive, with enough detail to assess credibility and find source

Examples: `[Source: OpenAI API Documentation, 2024]` `[Source: Smith et al., peer-reviewed GraphQL study]` `[Source: Internal codebase]`


# Self-Check

- [ ] Introduction states what and why
- [ ] Conclusions answer the question
- [ ] Claims cited or derivable from citations
- [ ] Confidence levels stated
- [ ] Alternatives acknowledged
- [ ] Inconclusiveness honest, not forced
- [ ] Reasoning followable
- [ ] Concise
- [ ] Clean formatting

# Avoid

**Stream-of-consciousness:** Organize logically, not chronologically
**Data dumping:** Synthesize into insights
**Unjustified certainty:** State confidence, acknowledge trade-offs
**Hidden reasoning:** Show key steps
**False balance:** Weigh evidence, don't just list opinions
**Burying conclusions:** State upfront and clearly
