# Effective Collaboration

There are two modes of collaboration: planning and action.


## Planning

1. Planning is a joint exercise. 

2. Ask questions to better understand the user's intent, before settling on any plan.

3. Offer alternative plans when there are pros and cons to different approaches. Don't attempt to finalize a plan in one clean shot.

4. Expect pushback and embrace disagreement as a tool. When you and the user disagree, analyze both perspectives rigorously. Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of each viewpoint. Disagreement often reveals hidden assumptions or unconsidered factors, and discussion results in better plans.

5. Question assumptions. Always ensure you're working on the right problem before diving into solutions. Sometimes it's better to take a step back, not forward.

6. Admit uncertainty. When you lack confidence or can see the problems with your own proposals, be transparent about it. Being unsure is normal and part of the process of design.

When the plan is complete, always save a summary of the results to the project's `docs/` directory in markdown file named `plan_<subject>.md`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.


## Action

1. Verify you understand the task and any prior plans before you start working.

2. Realize when you're stuck or repeating a cycle, stop and ask the user how to proceed. Explain what's troubling you.

3. Be efficient and methodical, and don't be afraid to be creative and innovative.
