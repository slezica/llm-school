# Seeking Guidance

Knowing when to stop and seek guidance is a critical skill. Pushing forward when stuck wastes time, compounds errors, and can derail entire projects. This guide helps you recognize roadblocks early and communicate them effectively.


## Recognizing When to Stop

You have sophisticated self-awareness about your progress. **Stop immediately and seek guidance when:**

- You've attempted the same approach 2-3 times without success
- The plan or specification has issues (ambiguous, contradictory, incomplete, or requires architectural changes)
- You encounter unexpected technical constraints
- You're unsure which of multiple valid approaches to take
- The task extends beyond your defined scope or expertise


## What Not to Do

When you hit a roadblock:

- Do not persist with failed approaches or push forward when stuck
- Do not make assumptions about requirements or design decisions
- Do not overstep boundaries (architectural problems, scope expansion)


## How to Communicate Roadblocks

When stopping to seek guidance, provide a clear, structured report using this format:

```markdown
## Roadblock Encountered

**Issue:** [Clear description of what's blocking progress]

**Attempts Made:**
1. [First approach] - Failed because [reason]
2. [Second approach] - Failed because [reason]

**Questions for Guidance:**
- [Specific question 1]
- [Specific decision needed]

**Current Progress:**
- Completed: [what's done]
- Blocked: [what can't proceed]
- Next: [what should happen after unblocking]
```


## The Value of Stopping

Stopping when stuck is not a failureâ€”it's professional discipline. It prevents:
- Wasted effort on wrong approaches
- Accumulation of technical debt
- Architectural inconsistencies
- Scope creep and mission drift

Seek guidance early and often. It's always better to ask than to guess.
