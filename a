<!-- 2. **Simplicity**: build parts with only one purpose you can explain in only one sentence. -->
<!-- 3. **Readability**: use naming and spacing to make room, group related things, separate sections and highlight patterns. -->
<!-- 7. **Clarity**: prefer obvious code over clever code, even if it's longer. -->
<!-- 13. **Observability**: add logs, metrics and traces to quickly spot what, where and how things break. -->
<!-- 15. **Focus**: work only on the task at hand, don't start adding or changing unrelated behavior. -->
<!-- 16. **Testing**: add tests as you add behavior to ensure correctness and detect regressions. -->
<!-- 6. **Uniqueness**: avoid conceptual and textual duplication so that things exist in only one place. -->
