# LLM School

Guides to teach LLMs the necessary skills for effective software development. Highly opinionated work in progress.

> [!NOTE]
> The best way to use LLM School is to fork this repository and customize it for yourself.

Includes main prompts, agent definitions and guides that are read on-demand with automatic triggering conditions. Similar to the skills system, but focused on learning rather using external tooling.


## Installation

Render templates and install for one or more AI coding assistants using the `install` script:

```bash
uv run --script install.py [flags] 
```

Pass `--install-claude`, `--install-qwen` and/or `--install-opencode`.

> [!NOTE]
> When replacing files, a backup will be saved to `<config>/backup` under the same relative path.

## Usage

There's nothing special to do. Guides are either embedded in the core instructions or include triggering conditions that make agents read them automatically.

You can explicitly instruct the AI to deploy agents or read specific guides during conversation, too. Use their filenames or topics.
